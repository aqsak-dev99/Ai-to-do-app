 ✨ Overview

AI Todo – Smart Task Manager is a next-generation productivity web app designed to help users organize, prioritize, and complete their daily tasks — with the power of artificial intelligence and an immersive glassmorphic design.
This project goes beyond a standard to-do list — it blends beautiful aesthetics, modern React development, and interactive experiences to make productivity feel fun and futuristic.
Built entirely with React 18 and Vite, the app delivers blazing-fast performance and a seamless user experience. Its AI engine can generate intelligent task suggestions and planning tips (or run in Demo Mode for offline use). Each task completion triggers a confetti celebration, rewarding progress and creating positive reinforcement loops — inspired by gamified UX principles.
With Dark/Light themes, drag-and-drop reordering, streak tracking, and local data persistence, AI Todo combines functionality and design polish that stands out both in your portfolio and in real-world use.
Whether you’re a developer looking to showcase front-end skills, a productivity enthusiast wanting an elegant task manager, or a client seeking a polished React app — AI Todo is the perfect example of creativity meeting code.
